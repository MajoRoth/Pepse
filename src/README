we implemented an infinite world using memento, and caretaker.
we rendered each times the object in our screen, the screen to the left and to the right.
so we have a world in size of 3 * screen_width.
when we move out or in from the boundaries, we call the memento and he removes and adds
the object if he has them. if not, we create new.

for every block x we a toss a non euqal probability coin to decide if we want to generate a tree.
the we choose a random height, and after that we generate a random size of canopy.
we get form game manager a functional interface that tells as for each block what is the height of
the terrain. with the help of that we can generate trees without the dependency of terrain.
we had a challenge with implementing the leaves - we need to stop the transition when they touched the ground.
we chose that Leaf should not inherit from block - because we didnt want to get infinite mass and collisions.
therefore to stop the transitions of the trees when touching the ground,
we overridden onCollision() and we removed the transitions and we added transitioning that do not repeat,
to zero the velocity after the library will delete the previous transition
we chose to implement the class Leaf that wasn't in the original API,
do to 2 main reasons:
1. the overridden for onCollision
2. to keep track on the transition (so we can delete them later)

BONUS: we added animals, we created them in a simmilar way to the avatar,
but we added the ability to randomly move and jump,
and we are creating them together with the terrain, and renders them dynamicly with the help of the memento.
